# Introduction #

jgpx is a library for working with GPX (GPS Exchange Format) files in the Java programming language. It provides convenient access to tracks, track segments and way points via Java objects, making it possible to calculate the length of tracks, distances between way points, elevations and the time spent on tracks or segments.

# GPX #

GPX (GPS Exchange Format) files are XML files that can be generated by most GPS handheld devices including Garmin and most of the popular GPS applications for the iPhone etc.

# Details #

The jgpx code is not meant to be a standalone application for visualizing GPS tracks or generating fancy statistics. Instead it is meant to be a library for application developers to use. It comes well documented, fully unit-tested and with an easy to grasp code structure.
